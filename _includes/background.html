      As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and
      design &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to
      always build applications that are scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user
      experiences.
